# FIREBrick 3
==========

Software for the open source hardware write-blocker/imager.

##### FIREBrick features:

* Disk imaging at speeds of up to 5Gb per minute (disk dependent)
* iSCSI write blocker function
* Supports disk encryption
* Automatic RAID storage detection
* Web frontend
* Portable â€“ fits in a small HTPC case
* Free, open source
* Can be fully customized to the needs of specific departments

To build a FIREBrick you need:

* ASRock E350M1 Motherboard
* >= 1Gb DDR3 Desktop RAM (1333 or 1066)
* Power supply/Case

This version of the FIREBrick runs a webserver, providing a web frontend. The user connects to the FIREBrick via an ethernet cable, the system provides an IP address via DHCP (192.168.0.x). Frontend accessible via a web browser (192.168.0.1).

This build needs a little more work, currently has basic working functionality; A disk can be exported over iSCSI.

An experimental UI has been developed for the FIREBrick called MAUI. It's based on principles from Morphological Analysis. A demo is available here: bit.ly/mamaui

# Getting Started:

* Download Ubuntu Server latest. http://www.ubuntu.com/download/server
* Download and install VirtualBox latest. https://www.virtualbox.org/
* Create and boot a VM using the Ubuntu Server ISO. (~2Gb RAM and >25Gb HD)
* In the new VM install git, build-essential, unzip on the VM (sudo apt-get install git build-essential unzip)
* Clone this repo (git clone --recursive https://github.com/leetobin/firebrick3)
* Run the make script (./firebrick3/extraFiles/start.sh) (wait a bit)
* You will now have a bzImage (./firebrick3/buildroot/output/images)
* Create a bootable USB (using sys-linux, see instructions below)
* OR ... emulate using the bzImage (qemu-system-x86_64 -kernel ./firebrick3/buildroot/output/images/bzImage -curses)
 

# Create a bootable USB key

Syslinux works well for this:
http://www.syslinux.org/wiki/index.php/The_Syslinux_Project

### From windows:

	>syslinux64.exe --mbr --active --directory / --install [name of drive such as "f:"]

Install syslinux to your key and create a simple config file like this one:

### SYSLINUX.CFG:
		
	default firebrick
	label firebrick
		linux /bzImage

Copy the bzImage (created in the build process above) file to your USB key.

Boot into the FIREBrick OS.

# Basic design guidelines

* Keep the UI consistent, add to the current frontend. Don't create a new design. We can worry about this when all the projects are nearing completion. Seriously, don't go spending time on UI design! It will most likely be scrapped/not used. Bottom line, get the functionality working using the current style.
* Once you have built the system, have a play around with buildroot. Go into ./firebrick3/buildroot and type (make menuconfig)
